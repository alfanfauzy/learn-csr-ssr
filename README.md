# Next.js SSR and CSR Learning Project

This project serves as a learning resource to understand and explore the concepts of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR) using Next.js. The goal is to provide hands-on experience with these rendering strategies and showcase their benefits and trade-offs.

## Introduction

Modern web applications can utilize different rendering techniques to optimize performance, user experience, and search engine optimization. This project uses Next.js, a popular React framework, to demonstrate Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR) approaches.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

- Demonstrates Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR) techniques.
- Provides examples of fetching data during server-side rendering and client-side rendering.
- Showcases the benefits and trade-offs of each rendering strategy.

## Technologies

- Next.js
- React
- Node.js

## Usage

This project includes examples of both SSR and CSR:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** The content is rendered on the server and sent to the client as fully-rendered HTML. This is beneficial for initial page load performance and SEO.

- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR):** The initial page is delivered to the client with minimal content, and additional content is fetched and rendered on the client side using JavaScript. This approach can lead to faster subsequent navigation once the initial page is loaded.

Each rendering approach has its own strengths and considerations. Explore the codebase to see how these techniques are implemented and how they affect page loading and user experience.
